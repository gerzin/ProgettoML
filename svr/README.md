# ML project
This repository contains the code of the ML project for the year 19/20, consisting in an implementation of a Support Vector Regressor using a Project Gradient Method to solve the internal quadratic problem.

## Requirements and how to run
To run the code you need a version of `Python >= 3.5.7`.
All the dependencies are listed in the file `requirements.txt` and can be 
installed with the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. 
(The use of a [virtual](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) environment is recommended).


##  Files description
* SVR.py contains the implementation of the support vector regressor.
* SLBQP.py contains the code of the quadratic problem solver. 
* The other files are utility modules and scripts.
* the directory [data](https://github.com/gerzin/ProgettoML/tree/master/svr/data) contains a README with all the informations on the data contained in it.
